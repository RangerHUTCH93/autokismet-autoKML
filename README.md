Autokismet maps Wi-Fi networks with GPS coordinates. It works best if you
walk around the area where your target network is (preferably in circles) 
so the GPS can better pinpoint where the network is.

AutoKML produces a KML file from the output files of AutoKismet. A KML 
file can be imported/upload to a mapping service such as Google Maps 
or a service such as www.gpsvisualizer.com.

You'll need a GPS dongle such as the 
"GlobalStat ND-105C Micro USB GPS Receiver"

You'll also need a Wireless card (large antennas are preffered) such as 
a card from this site http://www.wirelesshack.org/top-kali-linux-compatible-usb-adapters-dongles-2015.html

In my experience (I have T550) USB hubs cause overheating.

You'll need the packages "gpsd", "gpsd-clients"
